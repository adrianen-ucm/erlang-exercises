# Erlang concurrency exercises 1

The exercise answers are in the files `exercises.erl` and `bank.erl`, which can be compiled 
for example with 

```sh
erlc {exercises,bank}.erl 
```

Once compiled, some Erlang escripts with simple tests can be executed as
follows: 

```sh
chmod u+x {exercises,bank}_test
./exercises_test
./bank_test
```
