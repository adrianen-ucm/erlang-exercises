# Erlang higher-order exercises 

The exercise answers are in the files `my_lists.erl`, `trees.erl` and `trees_record.erl`. There is also an own exercise in `d_lists.erl`, and some [QuickCheck](http://www.quviq.com/products/erlang-quickcheck/) properties are offered for some of them in the files ended in `_prop.erl`. 

All of these can be compiled for example with

```sh
erlc *.erl 
```

and an Erlang escript which runs the tests for the properties can be executed as follows:

```sh
chmod u+x test
./test
```
